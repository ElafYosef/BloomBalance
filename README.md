# BloomBalance 

**BloomBalance** is a clean, modern UI/UX prototype built to streamline the booking experience for gyms, spas, and beauty salons. It allows users to explore nearby centers, book services, manage their appointments, and contact support — all through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
